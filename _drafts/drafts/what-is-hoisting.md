    Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.
    Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,
    ```javascript
    console.log(message); //output : undefined
    var message = ’The variable Has been hoisted’;
    ```
    The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,
    ```javascript
    var message;
    console.log(message);
    message = ’The variable Has been hoisted’;
    ```
