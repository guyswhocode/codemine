     Let's take console statement with unary operator as given below,
     ```javascript
     console.log(+ 'Hello');
     ```
     The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because the element is prefixed by the unary operator and the JavaScript interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. Since the conversion fails, the value of the statement results in NaN value.
