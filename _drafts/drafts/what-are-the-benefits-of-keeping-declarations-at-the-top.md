     It is recommended to keep all declarations at the top of each script or function. The benefits of doing this are,
     1. Gives cleaner code
     2. It provides a single place to look for local variables
     3. Easy to avoid unwanted global variables
     4. It reduces the possibility of unwanted re-declarations
