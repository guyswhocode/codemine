     No, javascript does not natively support enums. But there are different kind of solutions to simulate them even though they may not provide exact equivalent. For example, you can use freeze or seal on object,
     ```javascript
     var DaysEnum = Object.freeze({"monday":1, "tuesday":2, "wednesday":3, ...})
     ```
