     The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands which acts as a shortcut for if statement.
     ```javascript
     var isAuthenticated = false;
     console.log(isAuthenticated ? 'Hello, welcome' : 'Sorry, you are not authenticated'); //Sorry, you are not authenticated
     ```
