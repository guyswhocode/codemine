     ES6 provides raw strings feature using `String.raw()` method which is used to get the raw string form of template strings. This feature allows you to access the raw strings as they were entered, without processing escape sequences. For example, the usage would be as below,
     ```javascript
     var calculationString = String.raw `The sum of numbers is \n${1+2+3+4}!`;
     console.log(calculationString); // The sum of numbers is 10
     ```
     If you don't use raw strings, the newline character sequence will be processed by displaying the output in multiple lines
     ```
      var calculationString = `The sum of numbers is \n${1+2+3+4}!`;
      console.log(calculationString);
      // The sum of numbers is
      // 10
     ```
     Also, the raw property is available on the first argument to the tag function
     ```javascript
     function tag(strings) {
       console.log(strings.raw[0]);
     }
     ```
