    The window.history object contains the browsers history. You can load previous and next URLs in the history using back() and next() methods.
    ```javascript
    function goBack() {
      window.history.back()
    }
    function goForward() {
      window.history.forward()
    }
    ```
    **Note:** You can also access history without window prefix.
