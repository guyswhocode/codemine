     You can use `<noscript>` tag to detect javascript disabled or not. The code block inside `<noscript>` get executed when JavaScript is disabled, and are typically used to display alternative content when the page generated in JavaScript.
     ```javascript
     <script type="javascript">
         // JS related code goes here
     </script>
     <noscript>
         <a href="next_page.html?noJS=true">JavaScript is disabled in the apge. Please click Next Page</a>
     </noscript>
     ```
