     The Object.isSealed() method is used to determine if an object is sealed or not. An object is sealed if all of the below conditions hold true
     1. If it is not extensible.
     2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
     3. If it is not removable (but not necessarily non-writable).
     Let's see it in the action
     ```javascript
     const object = {
     property: 'Hello, Good morning'
     };

     Object.seal(object); // Using seal() method to seal the object

     console.log(Object.isSealed(object));      // checking whether the object is sealed or not
     ```
