     An object initializer is an expression that describes the initialization of an Object. The syntax for this expression is represented as a comma-delimited list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}). This is also known as literal notation. It is one of the ways to create an object.
     ```javascript
     var initObject = {a: 'John', b: 50, c: {}};

     console.log(initObject.a); // John
     ```
