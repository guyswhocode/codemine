     ```javascript
     [...'John Resig']
     ```
     The output of the array is ['J', 'o', 'h', 'n', '', 'R', 'e', 's', 'i', 'g']
     **Explanation:** The string is an iterable type and the spread operator with in an array maps every character of an iterable to one element. Hence, each character of a string becomes an element within an Array.
