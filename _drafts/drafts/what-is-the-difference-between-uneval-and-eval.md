title: What is the difference between uneval and eval 
categories: ["programming"] 
tags: ["JS"]
---
     The `uneval` function returns the source of a given object; whereas the `eval` function does the opposite, by evaluating that source code in a different memory area. Let's see an example to clarify the difference,
     ```javascript
     var msg = uneval(function greeting() { return 'Hello, Good morning'; });
     var greeting = eval(msg);
     greeting(); // returns "Hello, Good morning"
     ```
