title: How do you redeclare variables in switch block without an error

    If you try to redeclare variables in a `switch block` then it will cause errors because there is only one block. For example, the below code block throws a syntax error as below,
    ```javascript
    let counter = 1;
    switch(x) {
      case 0:
        let name;
        break;

      case 1:
        let name; // SyntaxError for redeclaration.
        break;
    }
    ```
    To avoid this error, you can create a nested block inside a case clause will create a new block scoped lexical environment.
    ```javascript
    let counter = 1;
        switch(x) {
          case 0: {
            let name;
            break;
          }
          case 1: {
            let name; // No SyntaxError for redeclaration.
            break;
          }
        }
    ```
