title: Why do we call javascript as dynamic language 
categories: ["programming"] 
tags: ["JS"]
---
     JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/re-assigned with values of all types.
     ```javascript
     let age = 50;    // age is a number now
     age  = 'old'; // age is a string now
     age  = true;  // age is a boolean
     ```
