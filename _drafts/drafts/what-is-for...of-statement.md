categories: ["programming"]

     The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects or elements such as built-in String, Array, Array-like objects (like arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. The basic usage of for...of statement on arrays would be as below,
     ```javascript
     let arrayIterable = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

     for (let value of arrayIterable) {
       value ++;
       console.log(value); // 11 21 31 41 51
     }
     ```
