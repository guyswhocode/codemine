     The uneval() is an inbuilt function which is used to create a string representation of the source code of an Object. It is a top-level function and is not associated with any object. Let's see the below example to know more about it's functionality,
     ```javascript
     var a = 1;
     uneval(a); // returns a String containing 1
     uneval(function user() {}); // returns "(function user(){})"
     ```
