    The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all. The type of undefined value is undefined too.
    ```javascript
    var user;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
    console.log(typeof(user)) //undefined
    ```
    Any variable can be emptied by setting the value to undefined.
    ```javascript
    user = undefined
    ```
