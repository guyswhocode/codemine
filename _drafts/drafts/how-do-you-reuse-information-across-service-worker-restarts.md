title: How do you reuse information across service worker restarts

    The problem with service worker is that it get terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's `onfetch` and `onmessage` handlers. In this case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB API in order to persist and reuse across restarts.
