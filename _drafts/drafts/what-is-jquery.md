     jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more”. For example, you can display welcome message on the page load using jQuery as below,
     ```javascript
     $(document).ready(function(){ // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
         alert('Welcome to jQuery world');
     });
     ```
     **Note:** You can download it from jquery official site or install it from CDNs, like google.
