        2. [0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets
        3. (a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |

        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. \d: Used to find a digit
        2. \s: Used to find a whitespace character
        3. \b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word
     3. **Quantifiers:** These are useful to define quantities
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n
