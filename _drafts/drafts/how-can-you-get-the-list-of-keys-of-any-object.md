     You can use `Object.keys()` method which is used return an array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop. For example, you can get the keys of a user object,
     ```javascript
     const user = {
       name: 'John',
       gender: 'male',
       age: 40
     };

     console.log(Object.keys(user)); //['name', 'gender', 'age']
     ```
