     The Object.entries() method is used to return an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop. Let's see the functionality of object.entries() method in an example,
     ```javascript
     const object = {
       a: 'Good morning',
       b: 100
     };

     for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
       console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); // a: 'Good morning'
                                        // b: 100
     }
     ```
     **Note:** The order is not guaranteed as object defined.
