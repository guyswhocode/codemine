title: What is a void operator 
categories: ["programming"] 
tags: ["JS"]

     The `void` operator evaluates the given expression and then returns undefined(i.e, without returning value). The syntax would be as below,
     ```javascript
     void (expression)
     void expression
     ```
     Let's display a message without any redirections or reloads
     ```javascript
     <a href="javascript:void(alert('Welcome to JS world'))">Click here to see a message</a>
     ```
     **Note:** This operator is often used to obtain the undefined primitive value, using "void(0)".
