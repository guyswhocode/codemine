    You can nest one callback inside in another callback to execute the actions sequentially one by one. This is known as callbacks in callbacks.
    ```javascript
    loadScript('/script1.js', function(script) {
       console.log('first script is loaded');

      loadScript('/script2.js', function(script) {

        console.log('second script is loaded');

        loadScript('/script3.js', function(script) {

            console.log('third script is loaded');
          // after all scripts are loaded
        });

      })

    });
    ```
