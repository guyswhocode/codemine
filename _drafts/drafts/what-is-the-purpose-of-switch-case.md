     The switch case statement in JavaScript is used for decision making purposes. In few cases, using the switch case statement is going to be more convenient than if-else statements. The syntax would be as below,
     ```javascript
     switch (expression)
     {
         case value1:
             statement1;
             break;
         case value2:
             statement2;
             break;
         .
         .
         case valueN:
             statementN;
             break;
         default:
             statementDefault;
     }
     ```
     The above multi-way branch statement provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.
