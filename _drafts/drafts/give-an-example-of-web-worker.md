    You need to follow below steps to start using web workers for counting example
    1. Create a Web Worker File:  You need to write a script to increment the count value. Let's name it as counter.js
    ```javascript
    let i = 0;

    function timedCount() {
      i = i + 1;
      postMessage(i);
      setTimeout("timedCount()",500);
    }

    timedCount();
    ```
    Here postMessage() method is used to post a message back to the HTML page
    2. Create a Web Worker Object: You can create a web worker object by checking for browser support. Let's name this file as web_worker_example.js
    ```javascript
    if (typeof(w) == "undefined") {
      w = new Worker("counter.js");
    }
    ```
    and we can receive messages from web worker
    ```javascript
    w.onmessage = function(event){
      document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = event.data;
    };
    ```
    3. Terminate a Web Worker:
    Web workers will continue to listen for messages (even after the external script is finished) until it is terminated. You can use terminate() method to terminate listening the messages.
    ```javascript
    w.terminate();
    ```
    4. Reuse the Web Worker: If you set the worker variable to undefined you can reuse the code
    ```javascript
    w = undefined;
    ```
