     The debugger statement invokes any available debugging functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.
     For example, in the below function a debugger statement has been inserted. So execution is paused at the debugger statement just like a breakpoint in the script source.
     ```javascript
     function getProfile() {
     // code goes here
     debugger;
     // code goes here
     }
     ```
