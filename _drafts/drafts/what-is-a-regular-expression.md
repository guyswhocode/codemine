     A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. You can use this search pattern for searching data in a text. These can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Let's see the syntax format now,
     ```javascript
     /pattern/modifiers;
     ```
     For example, the regular expression or search pattern with case-insensitive username would be,
     ```javascript
     /John/i
     ```
